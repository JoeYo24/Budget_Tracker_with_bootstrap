Made with : 
  Ruby on Rails v6.1.7
  Ruby v3.1.2
  React v18.2 
  victory v34
  mui v5 
  bootstrap v5
  react-dates v21.8

This was made by me in about a month and a half and I've worked on this project almost every day out of the month and a half it was being completed. I started with a front-end mock up to make sure it would look kind of how I wanted it to. I was going to be using tailwindcss, but unfortunately could not figure out how to get react, tailwindcss, and rails to work all together because of the lack of updated guides online. Then moved on to the back-end of the project and make sure I had all of the assets for the views, models, and controllers, and make sure that my schema had everything I'd need to start to connect the back-end to the front-end. Then I finally struggled through connecting the back-end to the front-end making sure users could log in first, then moving on to the addition of transactions, then moving on to the addition of goals, and finally on to the monthly comparisons. This project taught me that there's a lot you can do with back-end other than just feed it data and have it spit it out. 

User story: 
  the individuals who I envision using this are college age indivuduals or a little older who need to maintain a nice sized savings so when something eventually goes wrong you have enough to fix it.

Probably the hardest part of the project for me was getting goals and monthly comparisons to work the way I wanted them to. There's a lot of data that has to be managed by the back-end in specifically those two parts of the project like I have target date for goals managed by how much money you save per month then it has to calculate how many months it would take to save the amount inputted into the goal, and getting a specific type of transaction and having them summed up by month was pretty rough too. 

I also will never know if the months will go to 13 instead of cycling back to 1 like it should and I will also never know if monthly comparisons will automatically delete after 1 year like I have it set up to.
